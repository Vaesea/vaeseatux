# VaeseaTux

SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

Run and jump through multiple worlds, fighting off enemies by jumping
on them, bumping them from below or tossing objects at them, grabbing
power-ups and other stuff on the way.

VaeseaTux is a mod for SuperTux. It doesn't have much right now.


## Story: Tux has had enough.

After 64 (those who know... super mario 64...) years of Nolok capturing Penny every month, Tux has had enough (how did he not have enough with this (stuff) beforre?)

He learns where Nolok is now. "Egg Forest", a forest with 0 eggs. No eggs. Absolutely none. It's named after my old username.

It's only when he arrives to Bakey Island that he realizes that he went the wrong way because he's stupid.

## Installation

## Playing the game

Both keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change
the controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will
need to use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck,
right, left, action and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much
to tell about the first few, but the "action" key allows you to pick
up objects and use any powerup you got. For instance, with the fire
flower, you can shoot fireballs, or with the ice flower fire ice pellets.

Other useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu
or to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the
arrow keys or the mouse.

In the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to
enter the current level.

## Community

VaeseaTux doesn't have a community, it's just a mod that no one will probably see.
