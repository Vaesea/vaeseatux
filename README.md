###### AKA SuperTux 0.3.2 if it was 0.7-ified

## INFO
This mod aims to bring SuperTux 0.3.2 stuff to SuperTux 0.7, including:
- Every Level
- Every Sprite
- Every Enemy

There will also be various 0.7 enemies redrawn to fit the old art style. This can already be seen with the clownfish (Innocent / Harmless Fish) and the Swimming Fish, however, that one isn't redrawn and is instead the jumping fish but flipped.

And it also aims to finish 0.3.2 using the plans that the old SuperTux team had, such as:
- A good Forest World (The current one is not so great since it's a random thing of random levels, needs to be redone)
- Ghost Forest (The current one barely exists with just 1 level that transitions to it and then goes back to normal Forest)
- Big Forest Castle (The current one is very unfinished with just a test level named NOLOK and an unfinished Little Venice)
- Nolok Boss (Desert?) (Would probably work like the Yeti but with the throwing snails thing as it was originally intended)
- Desert World or Tropical Paradise (As seen in the SuperTux Media repository, there were plans to add a Desert World to SuperTux, but there were also plans for a Tropical Island which became Tropical Paradise)
- More usage of scripting
- Tux Flapping (This feature was actually added to SuperTux at some point and a test level was likely made around it named Flapping Parcous, however, it seems it was scrapped?)
- Swimming (Already done because SuperTux 0.6.3 added swimming)
- Sliding (Already done because SuperTux 0.7 added sliding)
- Re-adding Lives + Game Over
- Bird Creatures (Owl already done) (Some for Forest, some for Desert / Tropical)
